# Script-service

Script-service combines the power of [Nashorn](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-nashorn-2126515.html) with amazing Java libraries like [jsoup](http://jsoup.org) and [Rome](https://rometools.jira.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa). Together this creates a powerful environment where simple Javascript snippets can be crafted for web scraping and to produce RSS/Atom feeds, JSON documents or XML based of this data.

More docs to follow, for now have a look at the [examples/](examples/) to get an idea what can be achieved.
